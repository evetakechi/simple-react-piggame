This is simple piggame that I learn from Javascript Course in Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/)
So I apply this game and write with React.

GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
- score to win can change from 100 pionts
